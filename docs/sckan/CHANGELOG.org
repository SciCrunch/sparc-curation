#+options: p:t

* PLAN 2024-??-?? :future:
- NPO adjacency issues
- NPO cardinality issues

- NPO hasInstanceInTaxon
- ApiNATOMY models use wbrcm
- ApiNATOMY publication metadata

- NPO connections from composer
- NPO connections from sweat glands, muscles
- NPO mmset1:11 fix the combinatorial paths explosion currently ~(expt 5 4)~

- alpha :: NPO synaptic connectivity
- stretch :: ApiNATOMY species variance for whole models where not covered by NPO
* PLAN 2024-06-?? :future:
- NPO add populations from NLP kidney, liver
* RC 2024-03-26
- Other updated sparc community termset with corrections for REVA terms
* RC 2024-03-05
- ApiNATOMY splen fixed layer ordering issue for neruon 1
- ApiNATOMY aacar added new populations updated existing populations
- NPO aacar updated hasInstanceInTaxon axioms, added new and updated existing populations, updated partial orders
- NPO add populations for human and rat female reproductive system
- NPO populations now include alerts with information about e.g. uncertainty or interpretational issues
- Add vagus terms for REVA annotation use cases
* RC 2023-08-03
- NPO fix partial orders for ApiNATOMY populations that have multiple branches and intrinsic neurons
  *Note that the fix for intrinsic neurons means that partial orders now can and do contain cycles!*
- ApiNATOMY wbrcm updated with new regions
* RC 2023-07-31
- NPO fix partial orders for ApiNATOMY populations that include layers
* RC 2023-07-28
- NPO add populations from NLP semves and prostate
- NPO add citations for NLP and ApiNATOMY populations
- NPO various bugfixes for NLP populations
- NPO use hasAnatomicalSystemPhenotype, hasCircuitRolePhenotype, and hasClassificationPhenotype instead of hasPhenotype where appropriate
- ApiNATOMY wbrcm updated with new regions
* PROD 2023-05-05
CLOSED: <2023-06-08 Thu>
- ApiNATOMY aacar-6 fix missing A in A74 that generated a lyph with no metadata
- ApiNATOMY pancr-2 fix incorrect housing lyph pancreatic vasculature to wbkg pancreatic acinus
- ApiNATOMY splen-2 fix incorrect housing layer for nts and dmv
- NPO first pass at partial orders for ApiNATOMY populations
* RC 2023-04-29
- NPO add missing axioms so that aacar 7 and 8 are not inferred to be equivalent
- NPO add missing axioms so that sdcol j and l are not inferred to be equivalent
- NPO add missing axioms so that kblad 1 and 2 are not inferred to be equivalent
  note that the full location phenotype axiomatization including layers is distinct, however we have not added the layers yet
- NPO huang 2017 remove duplicate axioms
- NPO clean up npo.ttl generation process
- parcellation schemes now use atom.ttl as their base import
- ApiNATOMY add SciGraph model provenance endpoint
  https://scicrunch.org/api/1/sparc-scigraph/dynamic/demos/apinat/graphList.json
* RC 2023-04-12
- NPO add populations from NLP mmset4
- NPO partial orders for NPO populations
- NPO add forwardConnectionPhenotype axioms (synaptic connectivity) to ApiNATOMY populations
- NPO add hasTargetOrgan annotations for sanity check competency queries to ApiNATOMY populations
* PROD 2023-01-23
CLOSED: <2023-02-16 Thu>
- curation-export fix protocols.io api v3 v4
- sparc-community-terms sync from dashboard terms, avoid duplicate ontology class definitions
- SciGraph services new dynamic endpoints
  - =/dynamic/prod/npo/hasTaxon/{id}=
  - =/dynamic/prod/sparc/phenotypeAnatomy/{id}=
* RC 2023-01-17
- ApiNATOMY wbrcm new layers in certain lyphs and corrected hosting regions
- protcur.ttl now includes values from the sparc simple page note curation workflow
* PROD 2022-12-02
CLOSED: <2022-12-20 Tue>
- ApiNATOMY add model wbrcm for real this time
* RC 2022-11-28
- ApiNATOMY added model pancreas
- ApiNATOMY aacar-6 fixed axon locations
- ApiNATOMY bromo replaced FMA ids with UBERON and ILX ids
- ApiNATOMY models now contain version information in the form of a
  checksum on their input model ([[./queries.org::#apinat-models][example query]]).
- ApiNATOMY schema change =inheritedExternal -> inheritedOntologyTerms=
  =inheritedExternal= still exists and may appear in some models,
  however ontology terms now only show up under =inheritedOntologyTerms=
  and are no longer included in =inheritedExternals=.
- NPO added ebm sparc-nlp (replaces ebm nerves)
- NPO removed ebm nerves
- NPO aacar added hasInstanceInTaxon axioms
- NPO kblad added hasInstanceInTaxon axioms
- Blazegraph/SciGraph loaded graphs now embed information about
  build provenance that can be used to identify the version of a graph.
  See [[./queries.org::#embedded-load-provenance-record][embedded load provenance record]] for examples.
