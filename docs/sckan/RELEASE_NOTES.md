# SCKAN Release Notes

### Current Release: sckan-2026-02-11
### Previous Release: [sckan-2025-09-14](https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology/releases/tag/sckan-2025-09-14)

## Overview

This release includes significant content updates, data model enhancements, and corrections to improve data quality and consistency across the database.

## Content Updates

### New Population Additions

> **Note:** Population names are not intended to be comprehensive or exact. They are simply organizing names generated by the curator.

- `gastint (20)` - Populations originating in or projecting from gastrointestinal regions (e.g., colon, esophagus, small intestine, stomach)
- `portal (5)` - Populations gleaned from primary publications that include source data on the SPARC Portal. Dataset DOI is provided as a source.
- `pain1 (12)` - Nociceptive pain populations

### Population Corrections

- `femrep` - improved specificity for some anatomical structures as well as alert notes for some of the populations
- `senmot` - aligned term selections for ventral rami, intercostal, and subcostal nerves among populations

### Expert Consultant

As knowledge is often extracted from multiple literature sources, conferring with a domain expert is a process that the curator often undertakes to ensure accuracy and context. These domain experts may review the entire statement, or a particular component, such as anatomical structure naming. When the expert actively changes the content of the knowledge providing input from other sources or their expertise, the curator acknowledges the domain expert as support for the knowledge statement in addition to literature citation, annotated using the `expertConsultant` predicate. Individual expert consultants are referenced using their ORCiD identifiers. Consultancy from the SPARC Anatomical Working Group (SAWG) is referenced using the RRID URI (https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_018709) of the SAWG's InterLex page.

### Alert Notes

Alert notes have been added for `87` populations to provide context/warnings/important information about a population. The complexity of neuronal populations cannot always be fully represented within the A to B via C schema adopted in our modeling strategy. As a result, additional contextual and interpretative information is captured through alert notes associated with each population. These notes document, for instance, the spatial distribution of a population's cells of origin across spinal cord segments, as well as elements of the modeled statements (e.g., the nerve along which axons are inferred to travel) that are not yet supported by direct experimental evidence and have been included based on expert anatomical knowledge and informed inference. The Alert note is annotated using `alertNote` predicate, often with the following types provided as the leading text in the freetext section.


| Alert Type               | Description of Usage                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sex difference:          | Biological sex-related anatomical or physiological variation.                                                                                   |
| Laterality difference:   | Left-right asymmetries or functional lateralization.                                                                                            |
| Physiological condition: | Non-pathological conditions affecting innervation.                                                                                              |
| Evidence gap:            | When data are tentative or incomplete, further confirmation is needed.                                                                          |
| Connectivity ambiguity:  | When the projection or synapse identity is unclear.                                                                                             |
| Data source note:        | To flag the origin or context of the data.                                                                                                      |
| Spatial extent:          | Describes the full distribution of the population beyond the modeled epicenter.                                                                 |
| Anatomical inference:    | The structural relationship (projection, connection, overlap) is reasoned from adjacent evidence, comparative anatomy, or literature synthesis. |
| Model-based assumption:  | The relationship follows from computational or schematic modeling, not direct data.                                                             |
| Cross-species inference: | Observation is not demonstrated in the modeled species, but is inferred from a closely related one (e.g., rat → mouse).                        |

### Curation Notes

Curation notes are a distinct note type that has been added for various populations to provide additional context/important information that is generally relevant to the curation process. The Curation note is annotated using the `curationNote` predicate.

### Member Of Circuit

Member of circuit is in use to identify neuron populations that together provide a circuit phenotype. Nociceptive is the first phenotype to be represented in the data. Cell populations that are labeled as nociceptive include the sensory cells that have the pain-sensing apparatus as well as the cells they communicate with (second order sensory neurons, and the like). The member of circuit is modeled as using `isMemberOfCircuit` relation.

### Axon Phenotype

Axon phenotypes identify features of axons in the larger neuron population, such as fiber diameter and conduction velocity. C fibers, Aδ (A-delta) fibers, and Aβ (A-beta) fibers are examples of this phenotype. Axon phenotype is modeled using `hasAxonPhenotype` relation.

## Data Model Changes

### Sensory Connection Modeling (NLP-Curated Populations)

**Breaking Change:** The directionality of partial orders of the axonal paths for sensory connections has been updated to reflect projection paths rather than information flow.

- **Previous Model:** Partial orders for NLP-Curated populations reflected information flow from sensory terminals → CNS
- **New Model:** Partial orders represent anatomical projection paths:
  - Soma → Axon presynaptic terminals (CNS): Modeled using `hasAxonLocatedIn`
  - Soma → Peripheral sensory terminals: Modeled using `hasAxonLeadingToSensorySubcellularElementIn` (sensory axon)

**Impact:** This change provides a consistent representation of sensory populations across all models. Previously, the NLP-curated sensory connections were modeled based on information flow from sensory terminals while the connections from ApINATOMY models reflected projection direction from the soma.

## Metadata & Attribution Updates

### Expert Consultant Information

**mmset1, mmset4, mmset2cn populations:**

- Added missing expert consultants (ORCID ID URI and/or SAWG RRID URI)
- Added missing literature citations

**All populations (including ApiNATOMY):**

- Expert consultants consistently moved from `literatureCitation` to `expertConsultant` annotation property
- Improved metadata organization and attribution clarity

### Citation Cleanup

- Removed self-referencing URIs from `literatureCitation` fields across all neuron populations

## ApiNATOMY Updates

### Restored Populations

- **sstom:13** - Fixed and restored
- **sstom:14** - Fixed and restored

### Corrections

- **sstom 11 and sstom 12** - Minor partial order fixes
- **aacar 1** is now resorted and set as the forward connection of aacar 11

### Dendrite Modeling Changes

Dendrites colocated with soma have been removed from the following ApiNATOMY model populations:

- bolew
- pancr
- splen
- sstom

> **Note:** Curation notes documenting dendrite removal rationale are available. The original ApiNATOMY models with dendrites are preserved in the archived September 20, 2025 release.

### Forward Connection Updates

Forward connections to CL cell types have been temporarily removed pending future modeling decisions.

**Affected populations:**

- **liver:121** had forward connection to CL:0000182 (hepatocyte)
- **liver:132** had forward connection to CL:0009094 (endothelial cell of hepatic portal vein) and CL:1000488 (cholangiocyte).

> **Note:** cholangiocyte is synonymous to epithelial cell of bile duct.
